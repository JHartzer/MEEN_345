\begin{problem}{i}
What is the range of a 9-bit unsigned integer?\\

The range is from 0 to $2^9-1$ or \bf{0 to 511}.
\end{problem}

\begin{problem}{ii}
What is the range of a 9-bit signed integer? \\

The range is from $-2^8 to 2^8-1$ or \bf{-256 to 255}
\end{problem}

\begin{problem}{iii}
What is the binary representation of decimal 125 as a 9-bit unsigned integer? \\

I derived this by finding the largest power of 2 less than the original number and then subtracting and repeating. This processes looked like this: $125 - 2^6 = 61$. $61 - 2^5 = 29$. And so on. Then, I filled in each digit appropriately where if I used that power, the digit would be a 1.  \bf{001111101} 
\end{problem}

\begin{problem}{iv}
What is the binary representation of decimal 125 as a 9-bit signed integer?\\

For a nine-bit signed integer, since the number is less than $2^8$ and positive, the answer remains the same: \bf{001111101}
\end{problem}

\begin{problem}{v}
What is the binary representation of decimal -125 as a 9-bit signed integer?\\

To obtain the negative counterpart, I found the 1â€™s complement and then added one. This gave an answer of: \bf{110000011}
\end{problem}
