This is not the result that one would expect from the perspective of mathematics. From a math point of view, the answer is clearly exactly zero. However, these floating point numbers arenâ€™t representable as a simple, finite string of binary code. Therefore, there is rounding during each of the above operations. The total rounding is summarized by the above non-zero answer.
