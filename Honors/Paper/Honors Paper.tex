We will begin by looking at the widely known Hilbert Monoid. The monoid $M_{1,4}$ has the following factorizations for elements less than 100:\newline

\newpage
\noindent{}We can represent the above information graphically, where a $1$ represents irreducibility and $0$ represents reducibility, we produce the following graph of reducibility for the monoid:
